Surface density estimate (SDE) [1] extends kernel density estimate (KDE) from discrete data points to surfaces (i.e., polygon meshes),  which is used to model the positional uncertainty of input surfaces. This library provides OpenGL and WebGL based parallel implementations on computing SDE for a set of input surfaces.
